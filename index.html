    This website is designed to help you learn matrices. It is not a true standalone tool - it is to assist with other forms of teaching.
    It is recommended that you start with what a matrix is, before moving on to adding or subtracting matrices. The contents list below suggests
    in what order you should visit the pages of this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are feeling confident in your knowledge, perhaps you would like to test it - use the quiz feature.
